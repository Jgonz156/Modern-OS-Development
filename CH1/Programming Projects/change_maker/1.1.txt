Programming Project 1.1:
    Write, test, and debug a program in the language of your choice, to carry out any task you choose. Then write a list of all the 
    services you suspect the operating system is providing in order to support the execution of your sample program. If you think the 
    program is also relying on any middleare services, list those aswell.

I believe that some operating system services that are being provided are:

	Virtual memory to protect the operation of the program,
	
	Thread synchronization to ensure the program is not running past the threads responsible for returning values from the command line,
	
	Thread scheduling, since this program cannot be completed without user input, the OS must ensure running the program does not 
    deadlock the rest of the pc,
	
	The program files are being stored in the OS' file directory.
	
I believe some middleware services being provided are:

    Some communication translation between the terminal shell and the program interface.
